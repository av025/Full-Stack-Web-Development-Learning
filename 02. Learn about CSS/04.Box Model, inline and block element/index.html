    <h1>Box Model, Inline and Block Element</h1>
    <h2>Intro to Box Model</h2>
    <p class="info">
      The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how every HTML
      element is treated as a rectangular box on the webpage. It consists of
      four layers—content, padding, border, and margin—which together define the
      total space an element takes up and how it interacts with other elements
      in the layout.
    </p>
    <h3>Content Box (default)</h3>
    <div class="box-model-demo content-box">
      This is a content-box element.
      <br />
      Width: 300px + 40px (padding) + 20px (border) = 360px
      <br />
      Height: 200px + 40px (padding) + 20px (border) = 260px
    </div>
    <h3>Border Box</h3>
    <div class="box-model-demo border-box">
      This is a border-box element.
      <br />
      Width: 220px + 40px (padding) + 20px (border) = 300px
      <br />
      Height: 120px + 80px (padding) + 20px (border) = 200px
    </div>
    <p class="info">
      As we see above difference that when we are giving property
      <code>box-sizing : content-box;</code> than our element have some add on
      size by padding border and if we use property
      <code>box-sizing : border-box;</code> than all our padding, border and
      width or height equal total height and width we are provide to it not
      adding extra width or height.
    </p>
    <h2>Different type of Element</h2>
    <p class="info">
      In HTML mainly there was 3 type of elements and they play important role
      to style and place in our webpage layout.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Block Level Element</h4>
        <p>
          Block level element by default acquire whole width of our webpage and
          place next element from new line.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Inline Level Element</h4>
        <p>
          Inline Level Element only takes space according to our content and it
          allow other element to place next or adjacent to each other.
          <span class="red"
            >Here we have to note that in inline we can't give padding and
            height to inline element.
          </span>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Inline Block Level Element</h4>
        <p>
          Now this was special property which was provided by css to place our
          element according to our layout requirement so we can transform our
          inline element to have property of block level element also.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="block-level">
      This was p element example of block level element that takes whole width
      of our screen or viewport
      <span class="inline-level"
        >This was span element which was example of Inline element with only
        takes content space require.</span
      >
    </p>
    <h2>Components of Box Model</h2>
    <ul>
